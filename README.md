# SNORE NO MORE! 💦😴🎯

**Snore or get poured on yo pores.**

Coming into Grade 12, going to a hackathon felt wildly ambitious. We knew we had to be locked in **24/7**… but there was one issue:

We procrastinate like it’s a sport.

So instead of “trying harder,” we built a project that **forces focus** using escalating reminders — and if that fails… **you get sprayed.**

---

## Inspiration 💡
Hackathons are intense. You need to stay focused, sleep-deprived, and productive.

But we kept getting distracted and pushing things to the last minute, so we asked ourselves:

> What if procrastination had consequences?

That’s how **You Snooze You Lose (We Don’t Lose)** was born.

---

## What It Does ⚠️
This project is a **3-stage distraction punishment system** designed to grab your attention no matter how cooked you are.

### Stage 1: “Hey… lock in.”
- A voice command reminder
- A text message nudge  
✅ Good for light distractions

### Stage 2: “Bro. Seriously.”
If you’re still distracted:
- More aggressive voice command
- Phone call to your phone (because you’re probably on it)
✅ More pressure, harder to ignore

### Stage 3: Big Guns Activated 💦🔫
If you ignore everything:
- The turret activates
- A water gun **shoots the distracted victim (us)**
- If you try to run away, it **tracks you automatically**
- Keeps spraying until you stop being a procrastination demon

## How We Built It 🛠️
We built the entire system using **recyclable / repurposed materials** — because future innovators = eco-friendly legends 🌎♻️

### Hardware
- Base built from:
  - Trash cardboard
  - Chopsticks
  - Hot glue
- Turret system:
  - Water gun mounted on a servo-controlled platform
  - 3 servos on stilts to hold the blaster in the air
- Trigger mechanism:
  - String pull system to press the water gun trigger

### Software
- **OpenCV face tracking** to aim the turret at the target
- **MindFlex brainwave headset hacked** to read brain signals
- **Twilio** for messaging + calls
- **Arduino + Python integration** for servo control + real-time tracking

---

## Challenges We Ran Into 😭
This build fought back.

Biggest pain points:
- Multi-threading **Arduino + Python** without lag
- Getting **MindFlex brainwave data** to sync cleanly
- Delays in read/write cycles slowed down camera tracking
- Tracking got worse when data pipelines lagged

Eventually, we powered through, debugged everything, and got it working properly.

---

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of 🏆
- Built a fully functional **auto-tracking turret using scrap materials**
- Successfully integrated:
  - Arduino control + Python vision + MindFlex input
- Learned Twilio from scratch and got **texts + calls working**
- Created something terrifying enough to keep us productive

---

## What We Learned 📚
- How to use **Twilio** for real-world notification systems
- How to hack and extract data from **MindFlex brainwave headsets**
- Better electronics + circuitry intuition
- Most importantly…

**Discipline.**  
After this project we never missed a deadline again 😭💀

---

## What’s Next 🚀
We came into the hackathon with insane ideas (including a full life-size robot), but we had to scale down due to limited materials.

Now that we’ve proven the turret works, we want to expand by:
- Improving brain-signal detection + accuracy
- Making the system faster + more reliable
- Adding more “stages” and smarter distraction detection
- Exploring deeper brain-controlled interfaces for future builds

## Built With 🔧
- Arduino
- Python
- OpenCV
- Twilio
- MindFlex (brainwave headset)
- Servo motors
